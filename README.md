NFL First Down and Goal Best Plays Project
This project utilizes play by play data from 2022 by NFL Teams. The project explores the best plays for teams to run on first and goal inside of the 10. 
Logistic and linear regression was run to determine the best play yards and touchdown wise. NFL teams heavily favor the run inside the 10 but
more frequently score when passing.
